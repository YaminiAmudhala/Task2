    <p>Hi, I’m Amudhala Yamini, a B.Tech graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Annamacharya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Tirupati. I have a strong passion for software development and hands-on internship experience in both Data Analytics and Python programming. During my internships, I worked on real-time projects involving HR attrition analysis and developed applications like AI Chatbots, Voice Assistants, and License Plate Recognition systems.

        I have foundational knowledge in Java, SQL, HTML, and Python, and I'm continuously expanding my technical skills. I’ve also undertaken projects in IoT and robotics, including an automatic street light monitoring system and a gesture-controlled robotic arm. My strengths lie in quick learning, critical thinking, and effective problem-solving, and I enjoy combining creativity with technical expertise to contribute to innovative solutions.</p>
        <article><h2>Project on - Implementation of a Human Hand Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm</h2></article>
        <h3>Description</h3><h4><em>  A Human Hand Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm implementation enables users to control a robotic arm's movements and actions using their hand gestures. This system uses sensors and algorithms to interpret hand movements and translate them into commands that control the robotic arm's motors. Remote sensing technology is utilized to create a robotic arm controlled by gestures that moves wirelessly through human hand motions
